\section{Introduction}

This paper is on the construction of the one way function to a matrix multiplication problem - that of multiplying two $3 \times 3$ matrices to form a $6 \times 6$ matrix under a locally concatenative property. The matrix multiplication is a type of law of composition that operates on different layers. There may be some higher level mathematics mixed throughout the paper, however, thorough explanation will be attempted, otherwise can be ignored. The reason why it is included is to provide a bridge of multiple directions for the reader to take.

This paper aims to get the reader up to speed on the foundations of current computational complexity theory as it builds up a framework from scratch. At the end it provides a field for the reader to use in order to understand modern complexity theory in more depth. The intention is to provide as much insight as possible as to explore the science of computation.

\section{Foundations}

There exists a language such that it decides each monomial in the polynomial. In other words, there exists a set of deciders for each monomial in the polynomial where it decides if y is in the monomial. A decider in this term is not of the definition found originally in textbooks but one that is redefined in the below definition.

$\newline$

Given a polynomial

$p(x) = ax^2 + bx + c$

$p(x) = 3x^2 + 4x + 5$

$p(2) = 3(2)^2 + 4(2) + 5$

$p(2) = 12 + 8 + 5$

$\newline$

Let the decider be defined as the following:

$\\ $

Decider is a function $Decider<c x^{n}> \equiv c x^{n} = y$

such that
$x_1 \times x_2 \times ... \times x_n\ $ where n is equal to degree + constant is tested to be equivalent to y
and $x_1$ is the start
and $x\ degree\ times$ is the finish
then loop around $x_1 to x\ n\ times$ until it stops

For each state, $x_i$, i such that it is between 1 to n, $x_i$ contains a subgroup of size n and for each subgroup, $s_i$, there exists another subgroup and so on and so forth such that there are n layers starting from $x_i$ to 1. This is the same as saying that it is a rational expression.

$\newline$

$\textbf{Examples}$

Decider for $ax^2$ is $Decider<3 (2)^2> \equiv 3(2)^2 = 12$

Decider for $bx$ is $Decider<4 (2)^1> \equiv 4(2)^1 = 8$

Decider for $c$ is $Decider<5 (2)^1> \equiv 5(2)^0 = 5$

$\\ $

\section{Monomial of One Variable}

Given the definition of a decider:

Decider is a function $Decider<c x^n> \equiv c x^n = y$

$\\ $

A decider of at least one degree

$Decider< 3 x^4 > \equiv 3x^4 = y$

$\\ $

Contains $Decider<3 x^3> \equiv 3x^3 = y$

Contains $Decider<3 x^2> \equiv 3x^2 = y$

Contains $Decider<3 x^1> \equiv 3x^1 = y$

Contains $Decider<3 x^0> \equiv 3x^0 = y$

Hence it can be generalized to:

$Decider<c x^n>$ contains the sequence set 


$\\ $

There exists a start state and a finish state for each decider.

$\{start,...,finish\}$

$\\ $

$Decider<c x^n>,Decider<c x^{n-1}>,...,Decider<c x^0>$ 
which has a more formal definition called a rational expression. A rational expression on A over K is a semiring described as $\mathcal{E}_{n}$ such that $n\geq0$ where A is an alphabet (in our case a finite set of integers) and K is a commutative semiring. This means the following in terms of the decider

$\\ $

$Decider<c x^n>$ = $\mathcal{E}_{n}$

Contains $Decider<c x^{n-1}>$ = $\mathcal{E}_{n-1}$

...

Contains $Decider<c x^{1}>$ = $\mathcal{E}_{1}$

Contains $Decider<c x^0>$ = $\mathcal{E}_{0}$

$\\ $

The formal definition of a rational expression is defined below.

$\\ $

$\textbf{Definition. }$ $A_n = A_{n-1} \cup  {\left\{  E^* | E \in \mathcal{E}_{n-1}, (E,1)=0 \right\}}$

$\\ $

Here, $A_n$ is the set of monomials in the polynomial. $A_{n-1}$ are the monomials of degree n-1 and less of the polynomial and the set ${\left\{  E^* | E \in \mathcal{E}_{n-1}, (E,1)=0 \right\}}$ is equivalent to $Decider<cx^n>$ or equivalently the top of a single state of a decider. This theory has the opinion that it tries to describe finite recursion and nested for loops in a visual manner and, in so doing, this chain is chosen to be the best definition.

$\\ $

\begin{figure}[H]

  \label{fig:0103RationalExpression}
\end{figure}
Figure \ref{fig:0103RationalExpression} Visual example of $\mathcal{E}_n$ of a rational expression.

$\\ $

A rational function is defined as the following: 

$\\ $

K[x] and K[[x]]. Let K[[x]] describe a set of deciders as a polynomial representation. S is an element of K[[x]] meaning S is a decider.

$\\ $

S = $\sum_{n\geq 0}{a_n x^n}$

$\\ $

Unraveling a monomial decider can be reduced down to the layer $\mathcal{E}_0$. In the following proof of the theorem below, it can be noted that $q_finish$ isn't the same as $q\in q_accept$.

$\\ $

$\textbf{Theorem}$. A monomial decider represented as, $A_n$, can be mapped into a set consisting of the union of the base layer or $A_0 = \bigcup E_0$.

$\\ $

$\textbf{Corollary}$. A cyclic automata is in a monomial decider.

$\\ $

$\textit{Proof}$. For every $E_k$ in $A_n$, $E_k$ is a state that connects to $E_{k-1}$ where $1<k<n$.

For every $E_k$ to $E_{k-1}$, every semigroup of $q_{finish} \in E_0 \subset E_k$ connects to every other $q_{start}\in E_{k}$ forming a chain of cyclic semigroups.

Given $q_{finish}\in E_0$ in one semigroup connecting to another semigroup on $q_{start}\in E_k$, remove the connection and connect it to $q_{start}\in E_{k-1}$ where $1\leq k\leq n$ and n is a degree of the monomial.

This implies that $A_0 = \bigcup E_0$ hence it is a cyclic automata consisting of semigroups of $A_0$ that decides y on the monomial m(x).

$\\ $

The next theorem states that a monomial decider has a certain form called a p-adic number. 

$\\ $

\begin{figure}[H]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{0102theorem.jpg}
  \caption{Top down removal for equivalence of decider and cyclic automata.}
  \label{fig:0102theorem}
\end{figure}

$\\ $

$\textbf{Theorem}$. A monomial with simple p-adic form is in a decider.

$\\ $

$\textit{Proof}$. Start with the definition of p-adic number. Show its form in general. Show that it has the same description as a monomial decider. Is this another paper?

\section{Addition}

\begin{figure}[H]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{0104Addition.jpg}
  \caption{Addition of two deciders. The gradient of the circles remain the same after adding the two deciders together as the degree remains the same.}
  \label{fig:0104Addition}
\end{figure}

Given the first example:

$\\ $

$p(x)=3 x^2+4 x+5$

$p(2)=3(2)^2+4(2)+5$

$p(2)=12+8+5$

$\\ $

$m2=Decider<3 x^2>=3x^2$

$m1=Decider<4 x^1>=4 x$

$m0=Decider<5 x^0>=5$

$\\ $

Generalized to $m_x$ where x is the degree

Given polynomial functions, $p_1$ and $p_2$, they are commutative

$p_1(x)=m_a+...+m_0$

$p_2(x)=n_b+...+n_0$

$p_1(x)+p_2(x)=m_a+n_b+(m_{x+1}+n_{y+1})+...+(m_x+n_y)+...+(m_0+n_0)$ where $x=y$

$Decider<c_x x d_x>+Decider<c_y x d_y>$

$=Decider<c_x+c_y,x,d_x>=Deciders<c_x+c_y,x,d_y>$

$\implies d_x=d_y$

\section{Product}

\begin{figure}[H]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{0105Product.jpg}
  \caption{Product of two deciders. The gradient of the circles get denser after adding the two deciders together as the degree increases.}
  \label{fig:0105Product}
\end{figure}

Given two monomials in the language, a and b, the product of a and b is also in the language.

$\\ $

Given $Decider<c_x x d_x>$ and $Decider<c_y x d_y>$ is in language L

Show that the product $Decider<(c_x+c_y) x d_x\times d_y>$ is in L

$Decider<c_x x d_x> \times Decider<c_y x d_y>$

$=c_x x d_x c_y x d_y$

$=c_x  x d_x+d_y$

$=(c_x+c_y) x (d_x+d_y)$ is in L

$=Decider<(c_x+c_y) x (d_x+d_y)>$

\section{Problem with Matrices}

An important problem arising from deciders is representing them as matrices. The problem can be reformulated as the following: given a polynomial p of x, show that the monomial deciders represented in the language can't be contained in a finite matrix after a set number, n, such that $x^n$.

$\\ $

$\left[ n\times n \right]\left[ n\times n \right]=\left[ m\times m \right]$ such that $m \neq n$ and $m,n\geq 0$ and $m \geq n$

$\\ $

The focus of this article pertains to the question of whether or not there exists structures with certain properties that allow law of compositions to handle the above statement. The reason why this seems feasible is because of the following proposition found in Retenaur(66).

$\\ $

$\textit{Proposition.}$ Given a proper square matrix M over $\mathcal{E}$, there exist matrices $M_1$, $M_2$ of the same size as M over $\mathcal{E}$ such that $M_1 ~1 + MM_1$ and $M_2~1+M_2M$. In particular if K is a ring, 1 - M is an invertible modulo ~.

\section{Multivariable Monomials}

\begin{figure}[H]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[scale=1]{0106Multivariables.jpg}
  \caption{Multivariable monomial deciders can be seen treated as parallel processes running next to each other.}
  \label{fig:0106Multivariable}
\end{figure}

A monomial with more than one variable can be treated the same way as handling single variables at different degrees.

$\\ $

Addition gives the following:

$\\ $

$Decider<x^6yz^3> + Decider<x^6yz^3> = Decider<2x^6yz^3>$

$\\ $

Multiplication of the decider of the same degree gives the following:

$\\ $

$Decider<cx^n> \times Decider<cy^n> \times Decider<cz^z>$

$\equiv Decider<cx^n * cy^n * cz^n>$

$\equiv Decider<cxyz^{3n}>>$

where c is some constant

$\\ $

Multiplication of the decider of the different degrees gives the following:

$\\ $

$Decider<cx^n> \times Decider<cy^m> \times Decider<cz^l>$

$\equiv Decider<cx^n * cy^m * cz^l>$

$\equiv Decider<cx^{n+m+l}>$

where c is some constant

$\\ $

Given $Decider<3xy^2>$ and $Decider<7x^7y^{-1}>$

$\\ $

$Decider<3xy^2> \times Decider<7x^7y^{-1}> = Decider<21x^8y>$

$\\ $

Representing a multivariable monomial of different degrees is a similar line of thought. There are many representations of them, however, this article will choose the simplest and have them separate as seen in figure 1.6. In this manner, multivariable monomials are a set of individual one variable monomials running simultaneously.

\section{Generalized Monomial Deciders}

\begin{figure}[H]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[scale=1]{0107Generalized.jpg}
  \caption{Generalization of a monomial decider.}
  \label{fig:0107Generalized}
\end{figure}

A decider can be represented as the top layer only if short hand notation is necessary. In a way, this removes the constant which is a term called being $\textit{proper}$, it isn't necessary true all the time. 

$\\ $

Given a Decider<m(x)> where m(x) is a monomial, keep the top layer $S_n$ in $\mathcal{E_n}$. This is called the generalized monomial decider.

\section{Concentric Monomial Deciders}

\begin{figure}[H]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[scale=1]{0108Concentric.jpg}
  \caption{A concentric monomial decider is a generalized monomial decider with details missing.}
  \label{fig:0108Concentric}
\end{figure}

Generalization results in an interesting property if monomial decider is required to get in more depth. The top layer that remains from generalization remains the same and still forms a cycle, however, each state has one state and so forth up to n-1 depth.
 
\section{Constants}

\begin{figure}[H]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[scale=1]{0109Constants.png}
  \caption{A constant represented as monomial decider, $Decider<c x^0>$.}
  \label{fig:0109Constants}
\end{figure}

Given a constant, c, of a polynomial: f(x) = c, Constants are seen as linear directed acyclic graphs.

$\\ $

$Decider<c x^0> \equiv c = y$

$\\ $

Addition gives the following:

$Decider<c_1 x^0> + Decider<c_2 x^0> \equiv Decider<(c_1+c_2) x^0> \equiv Decider<c_1 + c_2>$

$\\ $

Multiplication gives the following: 

$Decider<c_1 x^0> \times Decider<c_2 x^0> \equiv Decider<c_1 c_2 x^0> \equiv Decider<c_1 c_2>$

$\\ $

There is no state in the decider where it loops back to the start. The constant is what separates a decider from a strictly mathematical cyclic object, semi-simple groups. This paper will mainly cover the cyclic part of the language.

\section{Division}

There are a finite amount of permutations, called decision functions, in a decider.

$\\ $

\begin{figure}[H]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{0110x5.jpg}
  \caption{One decision function of $Decider<x^5/x>$ to one decision function of $Decider<x^5/x^5>$.}
  \label{fig:0110x5overx}
\end{figure}

$\textit{Example}$. The following are deciders related to $x^5/x^i$ such that $0 \leq i \leq 5$.

$Decider<x^5 / x> \equiv Decider<x^5>/Decider<x^1>$

$Decider<x^5 / x^2> \equiv Decider<x^5>/Decider<x^2>$

$Decider<x^5 / x^3> \equiv Decider<x^5>/Decider<x^3>$

$Decider<x^5 / x^4> \equiv Decider<x^5>/Decider<x^4>$

$Decider<x^5 / x^5> \equiv Decider<x^5>/Decider<x^5>$

$\\ $

\section{Multiple Divisions}

\begin{figure}[H]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{0111MultipleDivisions.jpg}
  \caption{$Decider<x^5/x/x/x^2>$}
  \label{fig:0111MultipleDivisions}
\end{figure}

$\\ $

Given multiple operations of division, this forms a topological space where the order of operations are ignored.

$\\ $

$Decider<x^5/x^2/x/x> ~ Decider<x^5/x^2/x^2>$.

$Decider<x^5/x^2/x^1/x^1> ~ Decider<x^5/x^2/x^2>$

$\\ $

The topology of the operations on the cyclic structure of a decider forms its own area of study. A topology of a decider used in this paper is constructed below.

$\\ $

$\textbf{Definition}$. A topology on a set X is a collection $\tau$ of subsets of $X$ having the following properties:

1. $\emptyset$ and $X$ are in $\tau$

2. The union of elements of any sub-collection of $\tau$ is in $\tau$

3. The intersection of the elements of any finite sub-collection of $\tau$ is in $\tau$

$\\ $
A set X for which a topology $\tau$ has been specified is called a $\textbf{topological space}$. These three properties are used as template to construct a decider.

$\\ $

A decider of a monomial can have no decision functions or a set of decision functions so $\emptyset \in \tau$ or $D \subseteq \tau$

$\\ $

The union of sets of decision functions, $D$, of $\tau$ is in $\tau$.

$\\ $

$d_1, d_2 \in D \subseteq \tau$ such that $d_1 \cup d_2 \subseteq D \subseteq \tau$ implies $d_1, d_2 \in \tau$.

$\\ $

The intersection of sets of decision functions, $D$, of $\tau$ is in $\tau$. 

Given $d_1 \in D_1$ and $d_1 \in D_2$, then $d_1 \in D_1 \cap D_2 \subseteq \tau$.

$\\ $

Using the construction above, a general categorization of the states of a decider can be illustrated to find basic patterns using a term in topology called the basis.

$\\ $

$\textbf{Definition}$. If $X$ is a set, a basis for topology on X is a collection $\textit{B}$ of subsets of $X$ such that:

1. For each $x \in X$, there is at least one basis element $B$ containing $x$

2. If $x$ belongs to the intersection of two basis elements $B_1$ and $B_2$, then there is a basis element $B_3$ containing $x$ such that $B_3 \subset B_1 \cap B_2$.

$\\ $

A decision function has a start state and two possible outcomes, accept and reject. It can be generalized that there are three kinds of states - start, accept, and reject. These form a basis - $B_{start}$, $B_{accept}$, and $B_{reject}$. Each basis element has at least one state. A state can be in the basis elements of start and accept or start and  reject meaning that the intersection forms another basis element - the intersection of two basis elements. Thus, this is the topology of a decision function generated by $B_{start}$, $B_{accept}$, and $B_{reject}$. 

The next basis that can be formed is one that describes the operations on $x^{n+k}/Q(x^k)$ where Q is the divisions (e.g. $x^6/x^3/x^2$ where $Q(x^k)=x^3/x^2$). There are $6*2+6*1=18$ permutations possible in the example given. The basis elements that form $B_{6*2}$ and $B_{6*1}$ can be described. As a programmer, this statement means that even though there are many ways to write a function, there a finite amount of different combinations to write them in terms of having be as re-factored well.
 
\section{Equivalence}

\begin{figure}[H]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{0112Equivalence.jpg}
  \caption{$Decider<x^6/x^2>$}
  \label{fig:0112Equivalence}
\end{figure}

$Decider<x^6/x^1/x^1> ~ Decider<x^6/x^2>$

$\\ $
Determining if y is in f x is easy if we are given any monomial decider in the set of the language of polynomials and their representations has the possibility to give different representations if we consider them as representations of the function f of x.

$\\ $

$Decider<x^6/x^1/x^1> \sim Decider<x^6/x^2>$ in that they decide if y is in m(x) = $x^6/Q$

$\\ $

$\textbf{Theorem of Equivalence}$. Something on lines of $Decider<x^6/x^1/x^1> = Decider<x^6/x^2>$ such that there is some x such that the monomial represented by both deciders exists where f of x = y.

$\\ $

$\textit{Proof}$. Given $Decider<a(x,y)> = Decider<x^m> Decider<y^n>$ and the definition $Decider<b(x,y)> = Decider<y^n> Decider<x^m>$, show $Decider<a(x,y)> = Decider<b(x,y)>$.

$\\ $

Start with $Decider<a(x,y)> = Decider<x^m> Decider<y^n>$

Commute the variables because each decider decides there own monomial giving, $Decider<y^n> Decider<x^m>$.

This is equivalent to $Decider<b(x,y)>$

$\\ $

Start with $Decider<b(x,y)> = Decider<y^m> Decider<x^n>$

Commute the variables because each decider decides there own monomial giving, $Decider<x^n> Decider<y^m>$.

This is equivalent to $Decider<a(x,y)>$

\section{Reversing}

$\\ $

$Decider<x^6/x^1/x^1> \equiv $sequence of permutations such that it is equal to $\sum_{i}^{n-1}{i}$

$\\ $

$Decider<x^6/x^2> \equiv $ sequence of permutations of $x_i$, $x_j$ such that it equals n-1.

$\\ $

Is shown that by the permutation of the order of operations that $Decider<x^6/x^1/x^1>$ does not have the same number of permutations as $Decider<x^6/x^2>$

$\\ $

$\textbf{Theorem of Reversing}$. Given two representations, a,b in $Decider<m(x)/Q>$ where m(x) is monomial and Q is the division operations such that m(x)/Q $\geq $ 1, a != b implies that they don't have the same quotients space.

$\\ $

$\textit{Proof}.$ Given $Decider<a(x,y)> = Decider<x^m> Decider<y^n>$ and the definition $Decider<b(x,y)> = Decider<y^n> Decider<x^m>$, show $Decider<a(x,y)> \neq Decider<b(x,y)>$.

$\\ $

Start with $Decider<a(x,y)> = Decider<x^m> Decider<y^n>$. 

Then take $Decider<x^m y^n>$. 

Commute to get $Decider<y^n x^m>$.

This is not equivalent to $Decider<y^n> Decider<x^m> = Decider<b(x,y)>$.

$\\ $

Start with $Decider<b(x,y)> = Decider<y^n> Decider<x^m>$.

Then take $Decider<y^n x^m>$

Commute to get $Decider<x^m y^n>$

This is not equivalent to $Decider<x^m> Decider<y^n> = Decider<a(x,y)>$

\begin{figure}[H]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[scale=1]{0113Reversing.jpg}
  \caption{Two possible representations of $Decider<x^6/x/x>$.}
  \label{fig:0113Reversing}
\end{figure}

The two representations in 1.13 don't have the same quotient space and hence a != b.

\section{Corollary of Reversing}

Given a starting point of decider, the path the decider takes to decide if y is in the monomial, m(x) is unique to each representation. 

$\\ $
$\textbf{Corollary}$. Given a decider, d, in $Decider<m(x)>$ then there is path, p, that exists for d such that p = Path(d) = $s_1,s_2,...,s_i,...,s_n$ where i is count of the states in the decider of m(x).

$\\ $

$\textit{Example}$. Choose some x such that it is in path of $Decider<x^6/x^2>$ where $p = 001111$ then the following graph is what the decider is represented as.

\begin{figure}[H]

  \caption{Path of one representation of $Decider<x^6/x^2>$.}
  \label{fig:0114CorollaryOfReversing}
\end{figure}

\section{Godel's Theorem}

We see that there exists two statements from these theorems

$\\ $

1. $x = x$ from a theorem of equivalence

2. $x != x$ from a theorem of reversal

$\\ $

$\textbf{Example}$: Given some $d_1$,$d_2$,$d_3$,...,infinity in decision functions in $Decider<m(x)>$

$\\ $

1. $d_1 = d_2 = d_3 = ... = infinity$

2. $d_1 != d_2 != d_3 = ... != infinity$

$\\ $


\begin{figure}[H]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{0115Godels.jpg}
  \caption{Godel's illustrated from $Decider<x^6/x^2>$.}
  \label{fig:0115Godels}
\end{figure}

$\\ $

The different representations of a monomial through the language of monomial deciders will give the problem of undecidability. This means that despite many formal definitions of the monomial decider, there is no way to solve the problem of finding a specific representation of a monomial decider without having to guess or apply some sort of probability to it. Relating to the real line, given a real line a,b a $\leq$ b, there is infinite choices between a and b. As long as b and a $\geq $ 0, there requires some sort of probability of choosing some specific number that is between a and b.

\section{Constructing The One Way Function}

A probability exists to find a certain monomial decider in the set of it's variations. A/B = Probability where A is the monomial decider we want and B is the number of all the variations.

$\\ $

$\textit{Example}$: $d_1$,$d_2$,...,$d_6$ in $Decider<x^6>$ such that $d_i$ are all distinct. 

Choose one of the deciders in D through probability

Probability of choosing d in D is 1/6 so 0.16666667

\begin{figure}[H]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{0116Constructing.jpg}
  \caption{Picking a decision function, d, from $Decider<x^6/x^2>$.}
  \label{fig:0116Constructing}
\end{figure}


$\\ $

This is called the picking function and every time it is called, the probability is multiplied such that it is $n^k$. As an example, if the picking function is called twice using the example above, it is shown that the probability is:

$1/6 \times 1/6 = 1/6^2 = 1/36 = 02777778$

$\\ $

This is formally known as the one way function.
